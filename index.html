                <p>Ghana is a vibrant country located in West Africa, known for its rich history, diverse cultures, and stunning landscapes. 
                    It is bordered by Côte d'Ivoire to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, Togo to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south. Ghana was the first African country to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957, led by the visionary Kwame Nkrumah. 
                    The country’s economy is driven by industries such as gold mining, cocoa production, and oil extraction, with Ghana being one of the world’s largest producers of cocoa. 
                    Ghana is renowned for its cultural diversity, with over 70 ethnic groups, each with its own traditions, languages, and festivals. The country’s official language is English, but many locals speak various indigenous languages, including Akan, Ewe, and Ga.
                       Ghana is also famous for its warm hospitality, making it a welcoming destination for travelers and a key player in the African Union.</p>
